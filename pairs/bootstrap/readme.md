# Pair Problem

Let's bootstrap!  Recall that bootstrapping is sampling with replacement from a dataset to produce a new dataset of the same size.  Bootstrapping is used in random forests to guard against overfitting.  It also has wide application in many other areas of statistics - let's see two of them.

1) Produce a bootstrapped estimate of the median and 95 percent confidence interval over the median of the dependent variable in the [attached dataset](pair_boot.csv).

2) Use the attached data to run the linear model y = xb.  Produce bootstrapped estimates of the model parameters, b, and a 95% confidence interval over them.
